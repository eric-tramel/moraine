# Legacy Rust Trees (Non-Authoritative)

This directory is retained as a legacy source snapshot for historical/reference use.

Do not add new runtime logic under `rust/*`.

Use these authoritative workspace paths instead:

- Ingest: `apps/cortex-ingest` and `crates/cortex-ingest-core`
- MCP: `apps/cortex-mcp` and `crates/cortex-mcp-core`
